This data corpus contains 137,760 recorded ARINC 429 words from 10 different transmitters communicating with 6 different receivers. The data corpus is described in detail in section 3 of the above paper.
Each file contains a recording of a 246 words that were obtained from a combination of a transmitter, a receiver and optionally a second receiver which corresponds to one row in Table 1.
Each row has more than 1 corresponding file. There are twice as many words in the corpus for rows #1 and #14 than were used in the original paper.

The file format is HDF5, a hierarchical file format in which data is stored in a file-system-like manner.
Inside each file data is stored in groups:

- **Channel_1:** voltage levels of ARINC429 Line A, y-axis
- **Channel_2:** voltage levels of ARINC429 Line B, y-axis
- **General:** time duration, x-axis
- **metadata:** setup description. Most importantly transmitter ID, receiver ID, and additional receiver ID if present (**tx_id**, **rx_id** and **load** respectively)

Voltage levels are stored as 3 datasets (arrays) under the **Channel_1** and **Channel_2** groups:

- **Data:** A/D counts, a vector of pure numbers
- **YInc:** Y increment, voltage corresponding to 1 count, a scalar, measured in volts
- **YOrg:** Y origin, number of counts at voltage level 0, a scalar, measured in volts

Voltage levels are obtained from the following formula:

```
V (volts) = YOrg + Data * YInc
```

Time duration is stores as 3 datasets under the **General** group:

- **NumPoints:** Number of sampled points, a scalar, a pure number
- **XInc:** X increment, time between data points, a scalar, measured in seconds
- **XOrg:** X origin, time of the first point, a scalar, measured in seconds

A python example for extracting the metadata and the voltage levels:

```python
import h5py
import numpy as np

def read_metadata(filename):
    with h5py.File(filename, 'r') as f:
        metadata = {k: v[()] for (k, v) in f['metadata'].items()}

    return metadata

def read_sig(filename):
    with h5py.File(filename, 'r') as f:
        length = f['Channel_1/Data'].shape[0]

    sig_x, sig_y = read_sig_sliced(filename, 0, length)

    return sig_x, sig_y

def read_sig_sliced(filename, start, stop):
    with h5py.File(filename, 'r') as f:
        Data_a = f['Channel_1/Data'][start:stop]
        YInc_a = f['Channel_1/YInc'][()]
        YOrg_a = f['Channel_1/YOrg'][()]
        Data_b = f['Channel_2/Data'][start:stop]
        YInc_b = f['Channel_2/YInc'][()]
        YOrg_b = f['Channel_2/YOrg'][()]
        XInc = f['General/XInc'][()]

    line_a = YOrg_a + Data_a * YInc_a
    line_b = YOrg_b + Data_b * YInc_b
    sig_y = line_a - line_b
    sig_x = np.arange(sig_y.shape[0]) * XInc

    return sig_x, sig_y
```
